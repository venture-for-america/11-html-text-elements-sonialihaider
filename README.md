### Typography

We are given a range of tags to define the look and importance of our typography. Here are a few high use typography elements,

#### Headings

```html
<h1>Largest Heading</h1>
<h2>...</h2>
<h3>...</h3>
<h4>...</h4>
<h5>...</h5>
<h6>Smallest Heading</h6>
```

Headings allow us to create larger and smaller text, establishing a hierarchy for our content. `<h1>` is the largest of the headings and also carries the most importance for search engines. `<h2>` to `<h6>` the headings get progressively smaller and hold less importance.

#### Paragraphs

```html
<p>Lorem ipsum dolores</p>
```

Paragraphs separate blocks of text adding spacing before and after each block.

#### Line Break

```html
<br>
```

Line breaks add a soft line return for situations where you wish text to appear on the next line down.

#### Horizontal Rule

```html
<hr>
```

Horizontal rule creates a line across the screen for visually dividing two parts of the page.

#### Preformatted

```html
<pre>
  This text
    is
   preformatted!
</pre>
```

Preformatted allows us to create a white-space sensitive block of text. This can be useful for surrounding code elements or for writing out poems or expressive text where white-space matters.

#### Emphasized (Italic)

```html
<em>This text is italic.</em>
```

Emphasized text `<em>` stands out as italic text for situations when we want to call out specific words or phrases.

#### Strong (Bold)

```html
<strong>This text is bold.</strong>
```

Similar to emphasized we can make text stronger using `<strong>` which makes the text bold.

## Summary

- HTML text can be formatted using a variety of tags such as heading, paragraph, and list.
